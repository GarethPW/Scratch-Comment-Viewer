# Scratch-Comment-Viewer
A server script written in Python 2.7.11 to power the following Scratch project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/96895524/

scratchapi.py is a 3to2-conversion of Dylan5797's ScratchAPI, which can be found here: https://github.com/Dylan5797/ScratchAPI

There is a security flaw with the method in which passwords are handled in this version. It is highly recommended that you do not use this version of the server.
